### Prompting Claude to Generate Movie Magic

### Manually Iterating on Claude's Code

### Iteration 1: Copy code from Claude

The code generated by Claude was well modularized and fairly clean. I was able
to get it up and running in no time. Here's a snapshot of the app without any
modifications. This is already looking close to the desired design.

#### Iteration 2: UI cleanup

Here's the final implementation after some UI cleanup, tightening up the look &
feel. See [this commit]() for the effort involved.

This now matches my manual implementation exactly, wow! Very happy with Claude
so far.
