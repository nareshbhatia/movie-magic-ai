# Movie Magic v0

These are my notes from implementing Movie Magic using ChatGPT 4o.

## Development Log

### Create version 0 of the app in v0

#### Prompt 0 + a hand-sketched wireframe

"A movie streaming application called Movie Magic that allows the user to browse
and filter movies so they can add them to their watchlist."

v0 created a very good first implementation of the wireframe using Tailwind CSS
and shadcn/ui.

Here are the highlights:

- The application logo was spot on (film icon)
- The mode toggle and user icons were spot on, though non-functional
- Filter & Sort button was picked up correctly, though the icon did not match
- Total Movies badge was spot on, using the shadcn/ui `<Badge>` component
- The Movie List was formatted correctly, using the shadcn/ui `<Table>`
  component. The movie rows were coded as repeated, hard-coded `<TableRow>`
  elements. I would have preferred a loop driven by an array, but this was
  already pretty good.

#### Prompt 1

"Change the filter icon to ListFilter from lucide icons"

v0 was able to pick up the right icon.

#### Prompt 2

"Allow toggle button to switch between light and dark mode"

This did not work well. While the light mode remained unchanged, the dark mode
did not change the background to dark. Some text did change from black to white,
but in the process became invisible because the background was also white. The
implementation did not use `next-themes` as suggested in shadcn/ui docs. I
decided to leave this alone and make it work when I bring the code into my
repository.

#### Prompt 3

"Convert the mode toggle button into a dropdown menu with three items: Light,
Dark and System"

v0 faithfully did this, using the shadcn/ui `<DropdownMenu>` component.

#### Prompt 4

"Convert the Avatar into a Dropdown menu. First menu item is a menu label with
user's name & email, followed by a divider, and lastly a "Sign Out" button."

v0 carried out these instructions perfectly.

#### Prompt 5

"Convert the Filter & Sort button into a Sheet that pulls out a drawer from the
left side when clicked"

Again, flawless execution! v0 used the shadcn/ui `<Sheet>` component to pull out
a drawer when the button was clicked. It also put some meaningful filters in the
drawer panel.

#### Prompt 6

"In mobile form factor collapse the icon, application title and navigation links
into a drawer that is triggered by a hamburger menu"

v0 picked up these instructions remarkably well, collapsing the listed items
into a hamburger menu. Only issue was it did it for all form factors!

#### Prompt 7

"The collapsed hamburger menu should only appear in mobile mode. In tablet and
desktop mode the full application header should appear"

v0 did not this very well. It used the collapse menu for mobile as well as
tablet mode. Only the desktop mode had the full menu. Moreover, it moved the
Mode Toggle and the Avatar dropdown to the left corner. Let's see if we can fix
this.

#### Prompt 8

"Theme toggle and Avatar dropdown should always be in the right corner"

v0 followed the above instructions, but now dragged the hamburger icon to the
right too. Not good! I will fix this later manually.

#### Prompt 9

"In mobile mode, only show the movie image, title and genres. Hide the rank,
rating, year and runtime"

v0 executed this perfectly!

#### Prompt 10

"Improve the styling of the Movie table based on the following specifications:

1. Rank: 32px wide, right justified
2. Title: Fill the remaining space after accounting for all other columns
3. Rating: 48px wide, centered text
4. Release Year: 48px wide, right justified
5. Runtime: 48px wide, right justified"

v0 executed this perfectly â€“ no complains!

#### Prompt 11

"Make one of the movie titles really long"

This was to see how it handled long titles. Turns out that it wraps them, which
increases the row height for really long titles. This looks especially bad in
mobile form factors. Let's try to fix this.

#### Prompt 12

"The movie title should not wrap when it is too long to fit in the column."

v0 followed the instruction correctly. It stopped wrapping the titles and
truncated the really long ones. However the truncation alone didn't look very
good, so I asked it to show ellipses at the end of truncated titles. v0 was not
able to do this after several attempts. So I decided to drop the `<Table>`
implementation in favour of straight `<div>`s + Flexbox. This will give me more
control over the layout.

#### Prompt 13

"Replace table with <div>s using flexbox. Make sure to replicate all column
specs. All columns should have fixed widths, except for the Title colum which
should expand to fill the remaining space."

v0 followed the instructions fairly accurately, though it missed putting gaps
between the columns. When I asked it to put gaps, it added `margin-right` on
each column, which is also not very good. I prefer controlling the gap in flex
layouts using Tailwind's `gap` classes. That is exactly what I did. This is the
only time I went into the v0 editor to change the code manually!

While I was at it, I also changed the Movie List to be array driven, eliminating
the repeated markup for each row.

At this point, I had a pretty good version 0 and it was time to bring the code
into my Movie Magic repository. Here's the final implementation generated by v0:

### Iterate on v0 generated code manually

#### Iteration 1: Clean up v0 generated code

Given that the v0 code is runnable, it's a great start. However, that code is
JavaScript (in .js & .jsx files), not strictly typed. My Code Shaper templates
require very tight type checking + linting (see the Code Shaper ESLint
configuration
[here](https://github.com/code-shaper/code-shaper/tree/main/configs/eslint-config)),
so I had to clean up the v0 code a bit. For example, the following function
declaration gave a TypeScript error ("Parameter 'props' implicitly has an 'any'
type"), which had to be fixed.

```tsx
function FilmIcon(props) {
  ...
}
```
