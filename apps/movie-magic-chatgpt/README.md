# Movie Magic ChatGPT 4o

These are my notes from implementing Movie Magic using code generated by ChatGPT
4o.

## Screenshots

### Iteration 1

Here's the result after ironing out all the compilation issues. Note that the
visual design is really off. ChatGPT did not use any shadcn/ui components to
give the UI a polished look. Light/dark mode were also not implemented. Movies
entries didn't include the provided images. I had to give it the code to render
the image in 2/3 aspect ratio.

## Major Issues

- **Cumbersome workflow**: The fact that ChatGPT runs outside my IDE makes it a
  very cumbersome to use. Every time I give it some feedback, ChatGPT
  regenerates the entire project. The regeneration itself is painfully slow.
  Then I have to manually synchronize my code with the newly generated code.
  This is all very inefficient.
- **Does not generate compilable code**: ChatGPT makes no attempt to actually
  compile the generated code. It is a good start, but there are minor issues all
  over the place. The developer must step in to iron out all the issues before
  you can see a working app.
- **Does not understand Next.js and React Server Components**: Components that
  used hooks and event handlers were created as server components (no
  `'use client'`).
- **shadcn/ui not used at all**: It was very clear that ChatGPT did not
  understand what shadcn/ui is. It simply reiterated the guidance I gave it. For
  example, "Install components: npx shadcn-ui@latest add button", however it did
  not use any `<Button>` component in the code.
- **Light/Dark mode not implemented**: ChatGPT simply pointed to the references
  I gave it, and did not actually implement light/dark mode. The header only had
  a placeholder button for it.

## Nit Picks

- **Directory structure**: Although I had explicitly instructed ChatGPT to use
  Next's App Router, it initially put all pages under `/pages`. I had to guide
  it to move them to `/app` as required by the App Router. I also asked it to
  create a `/src` directory above `app`. Once it understood all this, it
  generated the right directory structure.
- **Absolute imports**: Initial code from ChatGPT contained long relative
  imports, e.g. `import { movies } from '../../../data/movies'` I had to tell it
  to use absolute imports to simplify import statements like this:
  `import { movies } from '@/data/movies'`.
- **Component Structure**: ChatGPT generated all components as arrow functions.
  My preference is function declarations. After giving this feedback, ChatGPT
  converted all components to function declarations.
- **Did not use movie images**: Initial iteration did not use movie images in
  the movie list. I had to tell it to do that. Also it started using inline
  styles instead of Tailwind classes. I finally gave it the exact `<img>`
  element I wanted it to use.

## Conclusion

ChatGPT gets away with lot of hand waving because it does not actually try to
compile the generated code. The developer then has to iron out all the issues to
make the code work.
